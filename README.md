
Random scripts/programs/nonsense that don't fit anywhere else. Use them as you see fit.

Included:

`billionlaughsgen.rb`:
  Generates a [Billion Laughs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs) XML file.


`bin2c.c`:
  Turns arbitrary data into a C structure that can be `#include`d.


`cgiserver.rb`:
  A dumb CGI server using webrick.


`cygwin-inspect-path.rb`:
  Prints executable files in Cygwins `$PATH`. Occasionally useful because Cygwin also includes `C:/windows/system32`.


`dbtest.rb`:
  A dumb example that shows how to use the `sequel` gem.
    

`dragfullwindow.c`:
  No idea. Wrote it ages ago.


`erb-with-binding.rb`:
  Shows how to use `erb` with custom binding, instead of using class instance variables and/or global vars (eeeeviiill!)


`inline_asm.c`:
  Some oddball preprocessor pseudo-assembly thing. I think I originally saw it on SO...


`ldd4win.cpp`:
  Something like a better `ldd` for Windows (works on cygwin, but also without cygwin).


`magic-when.cpp`:
  Evil template magic. It's like Haskell gave birth to Frankenstein!


`maxmem.cpp`:
  Determines the maximum amount of heap-allocatable MB.


`nbfi.cpp`:
  A dumb Brainfuck dialect that supports string literals and other things.


`opengl_sfml.cpp`:
  SFML with OpenGL, hand in hand. Probably not particularly useful.


`parse_args.php`:
  Parses `$argv` (or any other array) containing commandline args. Probably not very useful.


`physfs-example.c`:
  Simple PhysFS usage example.


`sdltest.rb`:
  The name explains it really well. It's an SDL example. 


`sentence-wall.rb`:
  Generates a wall of text based on an array of chars. Kind of difficult to explain, reading the code will probably make more sense.<br />
  Wrote it during the worldcup.


`song.c`:
  A chiptune example. Pipe the output to `/dev/dsp` on ancient distributions, and to `aplay` on modern distributions.


`text2bf.cpp`:
  Turns arbitrary text into Brainfuck code. Not exactly useful, but fun nonetheless.


`tiny.c`:
  Uses inline assembly to provide `write()`. Might be useful for someone planning on implementing their own version of `glibc` ... though, why the fuck would you want to do that?


`tuple-foreach.cpp`:
  Shows how to iterate over an `std::tuple`.
